# Nationality as a Risk Indicator for Modern Slavery in the UK

## Overview
This project introduces a preliminary dataset built from publicly available data. It combines UK asylum statistics with National Referral Mechanism (NRM) data on individuals referred as potential victims of modern slavery, organized by nationality and quarter. The dataset is normalized and structured to make it easy to explore trends, ask questions, and illustrate how nationality might relate to vulnerability. This is not a comprehensive study, but a demonstration of how a tailored dataset can highlight possible patterns and provide a foundation for deeper research
